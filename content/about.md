        body: >-
          Embarking on a life journey shaped by challenges, Michael A. Parins
          defied odds, drawing from his street-smart education to carve a unique
          path. Early on, Mike entered sales with vigor, always emphasizing the
          value of people. His journey includes leading sales for Jaws of Life
          in Iowa, spearheading a startup with a $38 million revenue and later,
          influencing education. Retirement proved elusive for Mike. After
          multiple attempts, he co-founded a safety and environmental consulting
          company, delivering expertise to key industries. Now, at 79, Mike's
          relentless spirit finds a new arena in Keynecta. Joined by daughter
          Jennifer and brother Tom, they aim to revolutionize the safety culture
          for small to medium-sized businesses. Mike's work is a testament to
          learning, growth and the unwavering drive to make a difference.
