      ### Integrating Compliance and Quality


      Compliance forms the bedrock of your Environment, Safety and Health (ES&H)
      program. A holistic approach includes OSHA, DOT Hazmat and specific
      environmental regulations and procedures. At Keynecta, we use a complete
      online system to integrate compliance requirements with quality practices,
      a proven method for identifying deficiencies and taking corrective
      actions.

        body: >-
          Employee connection and fostering a safety culture is at the heart of
          what we do. Trainers should take the time to have a discussion with
          employees to ensure they understand the training competencies. And
          establish a path for them to do so if they do not initially.
      - heading: Easily Track Training
        body: >-
          The Keynecta online safety dashboard provides training evaluation and
          scoring forms. Supervisors can easily reference training reports and
          receive view when specific trainings expire and require retraining.
