      fail to properly address it, resulting in future safety implications.


      ### The Keynecta System Teaches You How to Train


      The digital culture scoring dashboard provides tools and processes to
      integrate general OSHA compliance training into your standard operations.
      Trainers have expert knowledge of the topics they instruct, so now it's

      Keynecta takes a different approach to train employees. We see the value
      in providing each employee the resources to independently learn training
      competencies. We also value discussions and collaboration in the
      workplace.


      OSHA compliance training resources cover relevant topics and require
      collaboration and evaluation to ensure employees accurately understand all
      competencies. Training materials are accessible to employees for future
      reference when they need a refresher.
