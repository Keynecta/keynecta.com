As September is Suicide Prevention Month, Hurckman Mechanical Industries aims to prioritize the safety and well-being of our customers and the construction industry. We strongly emphasize the significance of preventing suicides in construction, providing guidance on seeking help and tackling the stigma surrounding mental health. Our belief is that it is essential to prioritize mental health and take preventative measures to promote a safer and healthier work environment.

Why Prevention Matters:

*   Men are four times more likely to die by suicide than women. This underscores the need for open conversations about mental health among male colleagues.
*   The construction industry faces alarmingly high suicide rates due to job stress and instability.

Seeking Help:

*   Encourage utilizing resources such as mental health counseling, speaking with a doctor, and being open with loved ones.
*   Foster a stigma-free environment for discussing mental health.
*   Share crisis hotline and mental health organization contacts.

Destigmatize Mental Health:

*   Conduct mental health education and awareness workshops.
*   Lead by example by sharing experiences and supporting colleagues.
*   Implement supportive policies like flexible work arrangements and mental health days.

As this year’s Suicide Prevention Month comes to an end, let’s prioritize the mental well-being of construction industry workers. By breaking the stigma, providing resources, and acknowledging the industry’s challenges, we can make a difference. Hurckman Mechanical Industries is here to support you.

If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide, seek help immediately through organizations like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988 or https://www.familyservicesnew.org/crisis-center/. You are not alone.
