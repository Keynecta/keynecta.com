With years of experience in the industry, we are proud to share our expertise to help you breathe easy and stay safe.

## Why Air Quality Matters

It’s important to maintain good indoor air quality for your health. Bad air quality can cause allergies, breathing problems, and more serious health issues. Since people spend a lot of time indoors, it’s important to know what pollutants are in the air.

At Hurckman Mechanical, we want to help you make informed decisions about air quality. We believe it’s important to educate our customers about air quality issues and provide you with the necessary information to do so.

## Our Expert Tips for Cleaner Air

1. **Regular Maintenance is Key**: Your air filtration system plays a crucial role in maintaining indoor air quality. Schedule regular maintenance with our team to clean or replace filters according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Contact [Dave Taylor](mailto:davetaylor@hurckman.com), to schedule a peak performance maintenance check. This ensures your system operates at its best, filtering out harmful particles effectively.
2. **Invest in Quality Filters**: Not all filters are created equal. We recommend investing in high-quality filters, MERV (Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value), which can capture even the tiniest airborne particles. If your HVAC system is designed for HEPA you may use HEPA filters and change the pre-filter at regular intervals.
3. **Keep Humidity in Check**: High humidity levels can lead to mold growth and worsen indoor air quality. Make sure your HVAC system is designed for dehumidification and or replaced with Dehumidification equipment. Our team is able to provide suggestions on humidity control and advise on the latest HVAC systems available.
4. **Ventilation Matters**: Proper ventilation is essential to ensure the circulation of fresh air. Our team can help design and install efficient ventilation systems tailored to your building’s requirements.
5. **Keep it Clean**: Regular cleaning of carpets, upholstery, and surfaces helps reduce dust and allergens. Our air filtration services go beyond the system itself, providing a comprehensive approach to cleaner indoor air.
