The business landscape of Northeast Wisconsin has roots going back for generations for a few long-time families. For the Hurckman family, three generations have made sure facilities of regional businesses are in efficient, working order. Today, Hurckman Mechanical Industries is one of the top HVAC and mechanical services firms in the Midwest, but its roots are more humble.

The firm will marked 65 years in business in January and was started by Franklin Benjamin Hurckman who was a sales professional. He started the business in the family home at 217 Oxford Street, Green Bay in 1953 after a lifetime in the sheet metal industry. The firm was initially called Hurckman Metal & Roofing, then Hurckman Metal Incorporated, and in 1972 John Franklin Hurckman took leadership of the business when his father retired. In 1994 Hurckman Mechanical Industries corporate office moved to 1450 Velp Ave., Green Bay and remains at this location today. Since 2004 Brad Franklin Hurckman is the third generation leading the company forward with an additional office in Central WI.

“My dad and grandfather founded our company on an honest work ethic which is still an important factor in our business today,” Brad Hurckman said. “We embrace our operating principle of ‘no empty promises’ and hold ourselves accountable to each customer and to each other.”

What began as a simple family business has grown into a technically superior group of associates offering a full range of HVAC services, customer support and mechanical services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Services include design, fabrication, and installation for plumbing, piping, insulation, HVAC, fabrication, sheet metal, and refrigeration.

“Today’s built environments are highly customized with sophisticated electronics and computerized models,” Hurckman said. “Intuitive technology has finally arrived where it is useful and brings tremendous value to the project and our customers.”

The firm employs 200 people with approximately 80% located at customer job sites. Project managers, superintendents, safety professionals, and trades people all working to deliver to our employers expectations. The corporate offices are also home to a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility where much work is pre-fabricated and delivered to job sites. Hurckman Mechanical Industries works with leading construction management firms throughout the Midwest and works directly with commercial, industrial, and manufacturing groups.

Team members can point to most areas of the state and take pride in saying “we built that,” but they also take pride in jobs done at area school districts, cheese factories, technical colleges, and commercial buildings. Of special note—Hurckman Mechanical has received the Associated General Contractors (AGC) of Wisconsin Safety Excellece Award twelve times since 2003. Since 2005, Hurckman has won the AGC’s BUILD Wisconsin awards 12 times for excellence in the specialty contracting sector.

Team leaders say the Hurckman difference is rooted in people and process. The job planning process depends on skill, dedication, and communication with work crews and the customer. But as Brad Hurckman is quick to say, it all boils down to looking a customer or a team member in the eyes and committing to deliver no matter the timeline or difficulty.
